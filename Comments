<!This is a website about our farm.
We have the standard start code, title and then I used style flex elements.
These are in the head tag.
Next is the body tag which encompasses the "meat and potatoes".
I learned and explored many different classes and styles.
Divs were used with bootstrap elements to create the layout of the page.
I used col grid sizing to achieve the stacking of text when page is reduced in width.
I used the flexbox to create the layout of the page.
